# FaceDetection
My first try with facedetection using opencv + java.

Features:
- Detect the number of faces in an image;
- Draw a JFrame with the given resource image;
- Support for close window (and finish the program) <br/>
  when the keys 'q' or ' ' (space) are typed.
  
## Todo
1. Draw a rectangle/square around the faces it has detected;
2. export the final image with the faces detected locally;
3. possibly use java spring boot to develop a web application.


## Example output
